### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

In 2020, I made a bold decision to embark on a new career path as a software developer. Since then, I have been dedicatedly honing my coding skills and expanding my knowledge in various programming languages and frameworks. One area that has particularly captured my passion is developing applications for teaching music. I have enthusiastically delved into the world of music theory, harmonies, and instruments, combining my coding expertise with my love for music. Through my journey, I have been leveraging my skills to create innovative and interactive apps that make learning music a delightful and engaging experience. With each project, I strive to incorporate intuitive user interfaces, comprehensive lesson structures, and even gamification elements to ensure students can grasp music concepts effectively while enjoying the process. As I continue to grow as a software developer, I am excited to explore new avenues and contribute to the realm of music education through technology.
